# Directory for Student Success (COMS 319)

## Purpose
At Iowa State University, prospective students often feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information they receive when visiting for the first time. Unfortunately, this can lead curious students to miss out on learning about the university's various student resources available on campus. To address this concern, we have developed an online catalog of student resources. This catalog aims to be a streamlined version of Iowa State University's Office of Student Assistance website, focusing specifically on resources relevant to students from all fields of study.

## Project Details
The “Directory for Student Success” is an online catalog of student resources. On the landing page, users can click through various resource categories and learn about various support services attributed to each one. On any given page, users should be able to easily navigate between category pages. To continue, on any given category page, a variety of information regarding the category’s specific resource should be available.
